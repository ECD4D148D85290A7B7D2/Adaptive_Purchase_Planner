# CS7IS5-A-SEM202-201920 ADAPTIVE APPLICATIONS

### Team-James-Adaptive-Purchase-Planner

## :bulb: The Idea.

>  **You're running to the store after work but realize you left your list at home (ugh). Instead of standing in the dairy aisle wondering how much milk you have left, next time use your phone as your personal grocery shopping assistant. APP (Adaptive Purchase Planner) takes out all the work for you, whether you want to share a virtual list with your spouse and even find easy deals. To help you get your grocery shop on, we've rounded up the best list-managing to streamline your next shopping trip.
The application can keep track of products users bought and recommend them to use when they need them, suggest other products that might interest them, so users can find better and cheaper products more easily.
Our objective is to build an application that will track the users' buying habits through explicit data collection and implicit recognition of users' choices in the app to suggest purchases in a timely manner.**

## James APP Demo.

## :pushpin: Demo Use Cases.

> We will give an in-depth walkthrough of our application in the final Report; the demo can be seen here:

### Our demo that was submitted alongside this report has 5 use cases:

⚫ **Case 1 (0:05):**
The user purchases an item from their Buy Now list that we recommended. The
user then confirms the items appears in their Buy Later list, and then confirms
that the item does not reappear in their Buy Now page.

⚫ **Case 2 (0:45):**
The user manually enters in an item and purchases it. Again, the user confirms
that the item has been added to the buy later screen and therefore is a part of
the user model.

⚫ **Case 3 (1:36):**
The user goes to the Missed Items page and decides they no longer want to be
recommended rice and they remove it and then confirms that it does not
reappear in the Missed Items page.

⚫ **Case 4 (2:10):**
The user views their purchase behavior which shows both our algorithmic and
machine learning models and compares some suggested frequencies.

⚫ **Case 5 (3.13):**
We show two different users and compare their “Top Pick” pages that display
recommendations based on our Collaborative Filtering.
